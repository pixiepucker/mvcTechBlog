## Description

This week's project was to build a full-stack web application for a blog-site. I accomplished this by utilizing the Module 14 lessons and implementing the following packages: MySQL2, Sequelize, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, Express-Session, Connect-Session-Sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, and Handlebars.js. I was to able find the patterns in the Module code to help build my app and utilized the style sheet that was available, although I did add custom colors and fonts. You can find my deployed application [here!](https://glacial-temple-63576.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

Clone down this repo, run 'npm init -y', then 'npm i' to install all dependencies. Once that's done enter the mysql shell by entering 'mysql -u root -p' and your password when prompted. Then you'll run 'source db/schema.sql;' in the shell and quit once that's done. You can populate the site by then running 'npm run seeds'. Finally, run 'npm start' to start the server on your local machine. Visit "http://localhost:3001/" to see the site up and running!

## Usage

This application is the front and backend of a blog site. All you have to do is enjoy (or despise) the freedom of the internet!
